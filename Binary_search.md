# Binary Search

## Setup

* 15 Cups
* 15 Ping Pong Balls with random numbers between 0 and 100
* Coins (Jelly Beans or M&M's)

The Ping Pong Balls are covered with the Cups placed in ascending order.

## Start

Give the participants at least 4 coins and the task to find a given number
under the cups. Tell them they are in order and where the smallest lies. For
every lookup they have to pay you one coin. The goal is to find the given
number using the fewest guesses possible.

The best solution would be to divide and conquer according to binary search
algorithms. Guide and ask them why they want to lookup a specific cup.
