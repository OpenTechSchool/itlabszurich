## Schedule

We have worked out two sensible schedules, depending on the number of work
stations and kids we have.  Check out the [slides][] we used in the workshop.

In this workshop, we used the [long schedule][] (slide #3.)  It consists of two
puzzle sessions, where we split up the students.  They are a warm-up session.
The coaches do the same puzzle twice, but only with half the class so the
workload is not too high.

One puzzle session featured the [Frog game][] using chairs and pillows, with
the [Pocket money][] quiz as a fallback if students finished early (or the
other block was late.)  The other did [Error correcting codes][] with the
corresponding card deck and [Binary search][] with some sweets and cups.

Afterwards, all coaches conducted a regular, 3-hour OpenTechSchool workshop.
We used the [Python for beginners][] material, which we translated to the
students' native language (German.)  We also offered them to work through it in
English since it was an international class and all students had an English
proficiency level of B1/B2 (that is, "Independent user.")  We provided enough
laptops so, theoretically, every student could work on their own machine but we
highly encouraged -- and they kind of automatically assembled -- group work.
The machines ran Ubuntu.

In the end, the kids got a tour through the Googleplex Zurich.  Google
sponsored loaner laptops, the venue, lunch, and some snacks/drinks.
